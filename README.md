Implemented two child classes Lecturer and Reviewer from the parent Mentor class.

Now only the Reviewer can give grades to the Student. And a Student can give grades to a Lecturer, but only if the Lecturer is assigned to the course to which the Student is attached. I also added examples.

Overloaded the magic method __str__ for all classes. Implemented the opportunity to compare lecturers and students according to average grades. Gave examples

Created 2 instances for each class. Added a function to calculate the average course grade for students and lecturers.
